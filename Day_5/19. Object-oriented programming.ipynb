    "Object-oriented programming is a way of programming that groups together related data and functions into **objects**, and makes it easier to design more complex programs. In traditional (procedural) programming, you can typically think of a program as an set of instructions that is read from top to bottom, with the exception of functions, which allow you to avoid repetitive code. In object-oriented programming, one instead thinks of a program mainly as setting up a number of 'types' of objects, and doing operations on them.\n",

If you are doing Astronomy, you could use a ``Star`` or ``Galaxy`` class that would be used to represent these objects. You can even use objects without defining actual methods, but just as a convenience to contain several variables - if you need to always handle cartesian point in your code, you could define:"
