    "You may have seen in the documentation sometimes somewhat strange looking arguments called somthing like ``args`` and ``kwargs``. What are these? These provide ways of conveniently passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function whose kind and number one does not know before-hand, or just allows one to pass-through arguments to functions called within another function. You may have already wondered how Python's *print()* function can handle the arbitrary number of parameters that one could pass to it. \n",
