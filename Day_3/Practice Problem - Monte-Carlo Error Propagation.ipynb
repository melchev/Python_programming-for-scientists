    "You have likely encountered the concept of propagation of uncertainty before (see [the usual rules here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Example_formulas)). The idea is that given measurements with uncertainties, we can find the uncertainty on the final result of an equation.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$F = \\frac{G~M_1~M_2}{r^2}$$\n",

    "which gives the gravitational force between two masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ separated by a distance $r$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we can try using a **Monte-Carlo** technique instead. The idea behind Monte-Carlo techniques is to generate many possible solutions using random numbers and using these to look at the overall results. In the above case, you can propagate uncertainties with a Monte-Carlo method by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* randomly sample values of $M_1$, $M_2$, and $r$, 1000000 times, using the means and standard deviations given above\n",
    "\n",
    "* compute the gravitational force for each set of values\n",
    "\n",
    "You should do this with Numpy arrays, and **without any loops**. You should then get an array of 1000000 different values for the forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot of the normalized histogram of these values of the force, and then overplot a Gaussian function with the mean and standard deviation derived with the standard error propagation rules. Make sure that you pick the range of x values in the plot wisely, so that the two distributions can be seen. Make sure there are also a sensible number of bins in the histogram so that you can compare the shape of the histogram and the Gaussian function. The two distributions should agree pretty well."

    "This example shows that the MC error propagation gives the correct probability distribution function (PDF) of the force, even if the analytical error propagation is technically correct in providing the standard deviation. The point is that the PDF is non-Gaussian. This happens because the uncertainties on the input numbers are large relative to the numbers. For instance, the uncertainty on the distance between both masses is about 30% of the distance. This means that a zero distance is about 3$\\sigma$ away, and that in 1000000 MC experiments, some distances will be drawn that are $\\leq0$. As a result, the error propagation contains a singularity, leading to extremely high forces. On the other hand, the force cannot be smaller than zero, unless an (unphysical) negative mass is drawn. This is possible for $M_2$, which also has a large uncertainty, and explains why the above histogram shows some MC experiments with a negative force."
